# Person Detection and Tracking

This project implements an optimized inference pipeline that can process long-duration videos to identify and track persons of interest, specifically distinguishing between children and therapists. The pipeline utilizes YOLOv8 for object detection and DeepSORT for tracking, providing real-time visualization of bounding boxes and unique IDs for detected individuals.

## Features

- **Optimized Inference Pipeline**: Efficiently processes long-duration videos to identify and track people.
- **Bounding Box Predictions**: Accurately detects and displays bounding boxes for children and therapists.
- **Unique ID Assignment**: Each detected person is assigned a unique ID for continuous tracking across frames.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: The predictions are plotted and displayed in real-time, facilitating immediate feedback and analysis.

## Requirements

1. **Python 3.8+**
2. **Libraries**: 
   - OpenCV
   - ultralytics
   - deep_sort_realtime
   - yt-dlp

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   If you havenâ€™t already cloned the repository, you can do so with:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   cd yourrepository
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**

   Install the required Python libraries using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download YOLOv8 Model**

   Ensure you have the YOLOv8 model file (`yolov8s.pt`). Place this file in the same directory as your script.

4. **Download Video from YouTube**

   The script can download a YouTube video automatically. Ensure you have the `yt-dlp` library installed.

## Usage

1. **Modify YouTube Video URL**

   Open the `predict.py` script and locate the following line:

   ```python
   youtube_video_url = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YqVEVbXQ1c'
   ```

   Replace `'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YqVEVbXQ1c'` with the URL of the YouTube video you want to process.

2. **Run the Script**

   You can run the script directly using Python:

   ```sh
   python predict.py
   ```

3. **Interact with the Output**

   The video will be displayed with bounding boxes and tracking IDs. Press 'q' to quit the video window.

## Code Explanation

- **Imports and Setup**

  The script imports necessary libraries, sets up the YOLOv8 model, initializes DeepSORT, and defines a function to download YouTube videos.

- **Video Processing**

  The script opens the video file, performs detection and tracking on each frame, and displays the results. YOLOv8 detects people, and DeepSORT tracks them across frames, maintaining unique IDs for each person.

- **Detection and Tracking**

  YOLOv8 is used for object detection to identify people in the video frames. DeepSORT is then used to track these detections across frames, maintaining unique IDs for each person.

## Troubleshooting

- **ModuleNotFoundError**: Ensure all required libraries are installed. Use `pip` to install missing modules.
- **Video File Issues**: Ensure the video file is properly downloaded and in the correct format.
- **Model File**: Ensure the YOLOv8 model file (`yolov8s.pt`) is correctly placed in the working directory.
